#password generator
** version 1 **
Majority of the code was based on two tutorials, W3Schools, and stack overflow.  
The one I learned the most from and got most of my functions from were from <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9sT03jEwcaw>.
but I got some pointers from this one <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duNmhKgtcsI&t=1582s>.
I followed along the tutorials so I could get the explanaitons but took some liberties on the actual code. 

   This project was tricky for me, but I learned a lot more fucntions and how things work a little more =, so I dont' feel as lost in javascript as i did before.
